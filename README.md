# ISBN-metadata
A Python 3 script that uses the xISBN web service to generate a list of the data of the book you searched in the WorldCat union catalog. In order to use this program Python 3 must be installed on your machine and you should check WorldCat and xISBN web services conditions.
 The output file is called "Books_ls.xml" and contains all the metadata.
